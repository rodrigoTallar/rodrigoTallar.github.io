                    My name is Rodrigo Tallar and I'm from the beautiful country of Chile.
                    Among other things, I'm a human being, a student, a gamer, climber and a developer.
                    I’m currently learning a lot of difficult and mostly useless things at the university.
                    All for the sake of obtaining a piece of paper called diploma. It's supposed to help me get hired, although I'm not entirely sure whether it actually does.
                    As a result I'm often feeling stupid because of it. 
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm also an enthusiastic gamer.
                    My gaming interests span a wide spectrum, but I have a special fondness for games like Old School Runescape and first-person shooters (FPS).
                    Despite my enthusiasm, I must confess that I'm not particularly skilled at them, but the fun is in the experience.
                    I built the PC I use for gaming, and I'm quite proud of it. It features a Ryzen 5 3600, a GTX 1660 Super, and 16 GB of RAM. 
                    More importantly, it's equipped with RGB lights, which give it a very cool appearance. &#128526;

                    <!-- Hey there, I'm Rodrigo Tallar, hailing from the beautiful country of Chile. I'm just your regular guy, juggling life as a student, gamer, climber, and developer. 
                    Right now, I'm knee-deep in some seriously mind-boggling university stuff, all in pursuit of that magical piece of paper they call a diploma. 
                    Supposedly, it's the golden ticket to landing a job, though I'm not entirely convinced it's a surefire deal. 
                    So, you'll often find me scratching my head and feeling a bit clueless.
                    <br><br>
                    Aside from the academic chaos, I'm a gaming fanatic. 
                    My gaming tastes are all over the map, but I've got a soft spot for games like Old School Runescape and first-person shooters (FPS). 
                    Admittedly, I'm not a pro at them, but it's all about the fun, right? Oh, and let's not forget my prized possession – the PC I built myself. 
                    It packs a Ryzen 5 3600, a GTX 1660 Super, and 16 GB of RAM. 
                    But the real star of the show? Those snazzy RGB lights that make it look absolutely cool. &#128526; -->
